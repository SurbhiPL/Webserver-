Python is a high-level, interpreted and object-oriented scripting language. Python was developed in 1990 by Guido Van Rossum, who works at Google. Python is a quick, frictionless and easy-to-learn language for automation.

**Python is a Beginner's Language.**

**Features:**

**Easy-to-learn:** Python has few keywords, a simple structure, and a clearly defined syntax. This allows the student to pick up the language quickly.

**Easy-to-read:** Python code is more clearly defined and visible to the eyes.

**Easy to maintain:** Python's source code is fairly easy to maintain.

**A broad standard library:** Python's bulk of the library is very portable and cross-platform compatible on UNIX, Windows, and Macintosh.

**Interactive Mode:** Python has support for an interactive mode which allows interactive testing and debugging of snippets of code.

**Portable:** Python can run on a wide variety of hardware platforms and has the same interface on all platforms.

**Extendable:** You can add low-level modules to the Python interpreter. These modules enable programmers to add to or customize their tools to be more efficient.

**Databases:** Python provides interfaces to all major commercial databases.

**GUI Programming:** Python supports GUI applications that can be created and ported to many system calls, libraries and Windows systems, such as Windows MFC, Macintosh, and the X Window system of Unix.

**Scalable:** Python provides a better structure and support for large programs than shell scripting.

To learn anything we must start from zero. This is a beginner's language and a must-have skill for DevOps engineers and coders.
